- 👋 Hi, I’m @aRacovita, I'm a student at the Technical Univerity Cluj-Napoca studying Computer Engineering
- 👀 I’m interested in program development, finance and leadership
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Operating Systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java, C#, C and C++ projects, but I'm a fast learner so as long as I can find a good team I can learn anything.
- 📫 How to reach me :
- Email: racovita.ag@gmail.com
- Instagram: @raco_is_here
- I would say that my greatest asset is my adaptability and the fact that I consider myself a generalist.
